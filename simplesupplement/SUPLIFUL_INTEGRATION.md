- âœ… Automated fulfillment
- âœ… Sample discounts

## Step-by-Step Integration

### PHASE 1: Match Products (DO THIS FIRST!)

1. **Log into your Supliful dashboard**
   - Go to https://supliful.com/catalog
   - Browse their 267 products

2. **Find matching products for our 30 supplements**
   - Open `src/App.jsx`

   - For each supplement, find the matching Supliful product
   - Replace `SUPLIFUL_XXX_ID` with actual Supliful product IDs

**Example:**
```javascript
'Creatine Monohydrate': {
  // ... other fields
  suplifulId: 'ACTUAL_SUPLIFUL_PRODUCT_ID_HERE', // Replace this!
  price: 24.99, // Update to match Supliful's price
}
```

3. **Create a spreadsheet** to track:
   | Our Supplement | Supliful Product Name | Supliful ID | Price |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | Creatine Monohydrate | [Find in catalog] | [ID] | $XX.XX |
   | Whey Protein Isolate | [Find in catalog] | [ID] | $XX.XX |
   | ... | ... | ... | ... |

       shopifyCheckoutUrl: 'https://your-store.myshopify.com/cart/add?id=VARIANT_ID'
     }
   }
   ```

4. Replace checkout button in cart:

     window.location.href = `https://your-store.myshopify.com/cart/${cartItems}`;
   };
   ```

#### Option 2: Shopify Storefront API (More Control)

   npm install shopify-buy
   ```

3. Create Shopify client in `App.jsx`:
   ```javascript
   import Client from 'shopify-buy';

   const shopifyClient = Client.buildClient({
     domain: 'your-store.myshopify.com',
     storefrontAccessToken: 'YOUR_TOKEN'
   });
   ```

4. Add to cart functionality:
   ```javascript
   const checkout = await shopifyClient.checkout.create();
   // Add line items from cart
   const checkoutWithItems = await shopifyClient.checkout.addLineItems(
     checkout.id,
     cart.map(item => ({
       variantId: item.shopifyVariantId,
       quantity: item.quantity
     }))
   );
   // Redirect to checkout
   window.location.href = checkoutWithItems.webUrl;
   ```

#### Option 3: Direct Link to Shopify Store (SIMPLEST)

1. Just link to your Shopify store!
2. Update checkout button:
   ```javascript
   <a href="https://your-store.myshopify.com">
     Checkout on Shopify
   </a>
   ```

### PHASE 4: Get Product IDs from Supliful

**How to find Supliful Product IDs:**

1. **Via Shopify Admin** (after Supliful integration):

   - Product details will show ID or SKU
   - Copy to `src/App.jsx`

3. **Via Shopify API**:

   ```

### PHASE 5: Update Prices

1. Check Supliful catalog for actual prices
2. Update each supplement in `SUPPLEMENT_DATABASE`:
   ```javascript
   price: 34.99, // Update to Supliful's price
   ```

### PHASE 6: Testing Workflow

1. **Test Quiz â†’ Recommendations**
   - Go through full quiz
   - Verify correct supplements recommended

2. **Test Cart**
   - Add supplements to cart
   - Adjust quantities
   - Remove items

3. **Test Checkout** (IMPORTANT!)
   - Click "Checkout with Supliful"
   - Should redirect to Shopify checkout
   - Complete test order with test payment
   - Verify Supliful receives order
   - Check that fulfillment is triggered

4. **Test Fulfillment**
   - Supliful should show order in dashboard
   - Status should change to "Fulfilling"
   - Test address gets shipping notification

## Quick Win: Get Running in 1 Hour

**Minimum Viable Integration:**

1. âœ… Find 5-10 most popular Supliful products (creatine, protein, collagen, etc.)
2. âœ… Add them to Shopify via Supliful app
3. âœ… Get Shopify product URLs
4. âœ… Update "Checkout" button to link to your Shopify store
5. âœ… Test one full order

**You don't need ALL 30 supplements to launch!** Start with the essentials:
- Creatine
- Whey Protein
- Pre-Workout
- Collagen
- Magnesium
- Omega-3
- Multivitamin

## Alternative: Wait for Supliful API

Supliful is building a **developer API in 2025**. When it launches:

1. You can integrate directly (no Shopify needed)
2. Checkout happens in your React app
3. Orders sent to Supliful via API
4. Completely white-labeled experience

For now, Shopify is the fastest path!

## Troubleshooting

**"I can't find a supplement in Supliful's catalog"**
- Search for similar products
- Or remove from recommendations (comment out in code)
- Focus on the ones they DO have

**"Prices don't match"**
- Update `price:` field in `SUPPLEMENT_DATABASE`
- Supliful prices may include your markup

**"Checkout isn't working"**
- Check Shopify product IDs are correct
- Verify checkout URL format
- Test with Shopify's test mode
