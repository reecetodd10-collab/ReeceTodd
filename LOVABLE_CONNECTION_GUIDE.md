## METHOD 1: Import from GitHub in Lovable (RECOMMENDED)

### Step 1: Check if your GitHub repo is PUBLIC
1. Go to: https://github.com/reecetodd10-collab/ReeceTodd
2. Look for a "Public" or "Private" badge near the repo name
3. If it says "Private":
   - Click "Settings" (top right of repo)
   - Scroll down to "Danger Zone"
   - Click "Change visibility" → Make public
   - Type the repo name to confirm

### Step 2: Open Lovable
1. Go to https://lovable.dev
2. Log in to your account

### Step 3: Create New Project from GitHub
1. Click **"Create New Project"** or **"New Project"**
2. Look for option: **"Import from GitHub"** or **"Connect to GitHub"**
3. Click it

### Step 4: Authorize GitHub (if prompted)

   - This is CRITICAL - tells Lovable where the code is!

## METHOD 3: Share a Lovable-Compatible Link

If Lovable has a "Share Project" or "Import from URL" feature:

1. You can share your GitHub folder directly:
   ```
   https://github.com/reecetodd10-collab/ReeceTodd/tree/claude/review-current-code-011CUMbBDAkQyNjZp9hTpUEY/simplesupplement-export
   ```

2. Or download the compressed file and upload it:
   - File: `/home/user/ReeceTodd/simplesupplement-complete.tar.gz`
   - Extract and upload

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: "Lovable shows blank or can't find files"
**Solution**: Make sure you set the **Root Directory** to `simplesupplement-export`
- The code is NOT in the root of your repo
- It's in the subfolder `simplesupplement-export/`

### Issue: "GitHub connection not working"
**Solutions**:
1. Make sure repo is PUBLIC (not private)
2. Re-authorize GitHub in Lovable settings
3. Try disconnecting and reconnecting GitHub
4. Use METHOD 2 (manual upload) instead

### Issue: "Lovable can't see the branch"
**Solution**:
- Merge your branch to `main` first
- Or select the branch name exactly: `claude/review-current-code-011CUMbBDAkQyNjZp9hTpUEY`

### Issue: "Import fails or times out"
**Solution**: Use METHOD 2 (manual file upload)

### Issue: "Missing dependencies errors"
**Solution**:
1. Make sure package.json was imported correctly
2. Run `npm install` in Lovable's terminal
3. Check that Tailwind version is 3.4.18 (not v4)
