      q: "Is this medical advice?",
      a: "No. SmartSupp provides educational information only. Always consult your healthcare provider before starting any supplement regimen, especially if you have medical conditions or take medications."
    },
    {
      q: "How accurate is the SmartSupp AI?",
      a: "Our recommendations are based on peer-reviewed research and evidence-based guidelines. However, individual responses vary. We provide a strong starting point—adjust based on your results and healthcare provider input."
    },
    {
      q: "How long before I see results?",
      a: "It depends on your goals and the supplements. Some effects (like caffeine) are immediate. Others (like creatine for strength or collagen for skin) take 4-12 weeks of consistent use. We recommend giving your stack at least 8 weeks."
    },
    {
      q: "Can I customize my stack?",
      a: "Absolutely! Our quiz generates a starting stack based on your goals. You can add or remove supplements, adjust dosages, and refine as you learn what works for you."
    },
    {
      q: "What if I have budget constraints?",
      a: 'We mark supplements by priority: Essential, High, or Medium. Start with the Essential supplements for your goal, then add others as budget allows. You do not need everything at once!'
    },
    {
      q: "Are you sensitive to caffeine?",
      a: "Yes! Our quiz asks about caffeine sensitivity. If you indicate sensitivity, we will avoid or adjust caffeine-containing supplements in your stack."
    },
    {
      q: "Are supplements safe?",
      a: "When used appropriately, most supplements are safe for healthy adults. However, quality matters—choose reputable brands. Always consult your doctor, especially if pregnant, nursing, or taking medications."
    },
    {
      q: "Do I need to take supplements forever?",
      a: "Not necessarily. Some people use supplements short-term (e.g., during a cut or bulk). Others take foundational supplements (like Vitamin D, Omega-3) long-term for overall health. It is personal and flexible."
