      question: "How does SmartStack AI work?",
      answer: "SmartStack AI uses advanced algorithms to analyze your fitness goals, lifestyle, diet, and experience level. It cross-references this information with our database of 42+ premium supplements to build a personalized stack tailored specifically to you. The entire process takes about 2 minutes and provides dosage recommendations, timing, and scientific reasoning for each supplement."
    },
    {
      question: "Is SmartSupp free to use?",
      answer: "Yes! Our AI-powered recommendation tools (SmartStack AI and SmartFitt) are completely free to use. There's no credit card required, no subscription, and no hidden fees. You only pay if you decide to purchase supplements through our Supliful integration."
    },
    {
      question: "What makes your supplements different?",
      answer: "We partner with premium supplement brands through Supliful to ensure you receive high-quality, third-party tested products. Every supplement in our catalog is science-backed and selected based on research efficacy. We focus on essential supplements with proven benefits rather than trendy, unproven ingredients."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use SmartSupp if I'm a beginner?",
      answer: "Absolutely! SmartStack AI is designed for all experience levels, from complete beginners to advanced athletes. Our AI adjusts recommendations based on your experience level, ensuring you start with foundational supplements and can progress as you advance in your fitness journey."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does shipping take?",
      answer: "Shipping times vary based on your location and the products ordered. Most orders through our Supliful integration arrive within 5-7 business days for domestic shipping. You'll receive tracking information once your order ships."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I adjust my supplement stack over time?",
      answer: "Yes! We recommend retaking the SmartStack AI quiz every 8-12 weeks or whenever your goals change significantly. As you progress in your fitness journey, your supplement needs may evolve. Our AI will adjust recommendations based on your updated information."
    },
    {
      question: "Are the supplements safe?",
      answer: "All supplements in our catalog are from reputable brands and undergo third-party testing for quality and purity. However, we always recommend consulting with your healthcare provider before starting any new supplement regimen, especially if you have pre-existing health conditions or take medications."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I don't like a recommended supplement?",
      answer: "You have complete control over your stack. You can remove any supplement from your recommendations and only purchase what you're comfortable with. Our AI provides the reasoning behind each recommendation, so you can make informed decisions."
